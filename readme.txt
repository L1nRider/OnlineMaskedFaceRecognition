train.ipynb under the same directory contains most results during training process

./pyfiles/create_dataset.py         can create dataset of faces of your own and faces of others
./pyfiles/train.py                  designing and training the CNN
./pyfiles/recognition.py            takes in webcam video stream and do recognition
./data                              where datasets are stored


How to run my code:

1.Download the dataset as instructed in ./data/readme.txt
2.Check your webcam, make sure it works
3.Run ./pyfiles/create_dataset.py to create dataset of your own face
4.Run ./pyfiles/train.py to retrain the model
3.Run ./pyfiles/recognition.py to do recognition
