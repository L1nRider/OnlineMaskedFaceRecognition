Description:
train.ipynb under the same directory contains most result during training process

./pyfiles/create_dataset.py         can create dataset of your own face
./pyfiles/train.py                        contains the design and training of the CNN
./pyfiles/recognition.py              takes in webcam video stream and do recognition

./data where datasets are stored
